UPE Maze Solver Fall 2018

To run the program, the user must have python3 installed on his/her machine. 
Additionally, the requests module must be installed using pip, which too must be installed.

The script requires a unqiue student ID to be able to generate the tokens and hence the mazes, so
the user must manually input this information within the code on line 100 as the second argument to Game.
Because of time constraints, the submission provided requires the user to run the script manually
each time he/she wishes to complete the next level of the maze. To run the script itself, the user
simply needs to type the appropriate command line command, such as:
	py maze.py
and hit enter. Once the level is complete, the command line will display a message stating completion,
and the user simply enters the command again to complete the next stage.
